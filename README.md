# Wait for Code Pipeline action

GitHub Action to wait for Code Pipeline.

## Workflow Action

### Inputs

Action inputs can be found within the [action.yml](./action.yml) file.

### Generating dist/index.js

We use [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to package the action into an
executable file. This removes the need to either check in the node_modules
folder or build the action prior to using.

We need to ensure that the dist folder is updated whenever there is a
functionality change, otherwise we won't be running the correct version within
jobs that use this action.

Before checking creating your Pull Request you should ensure that you have
built this file by running `npm run build` within the root directory.

A blocking workflow called [check-dist](.github/workflows/check-dist.yml) is
enabled that checks this dist folder for changes happens at both push to main
and on pull request events.
